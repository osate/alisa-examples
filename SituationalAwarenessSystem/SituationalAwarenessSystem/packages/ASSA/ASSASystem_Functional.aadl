ASSASystem renames system ASSASystem::ASSASystem;

-- This package contains the specification of the ASSA functional architecture.
-- It is specified for a specific sensor configuration (APR39D and WW)
-- We provide two variants, one for a single sensor stream processed by a DCM, 
-- the other with a DCFM processing two sensor streams.
-- The specification incldues end to end flow specification for latency analysis.
-- The data conversion service and data storage service are represented as infrastructure services.
-- The connections between the ASSA functions are appropriately bound to these services.
-- As a result of this binding the latency analysis includes their latency contributions.
